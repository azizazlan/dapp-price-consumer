# Dapp-price-consumer

The DApp or the frontend web app is built using vite framework. The smart contracts part are built using hardhat and chainlink's AggregatorV2Interface smart contract. This project was built to test my understanding after reading [this](https://docs.chain.link/docs/consuming-data-feeds/).
